This code solves the 2D Euler equations in a regular cartesian mesh
using a 2nd order godunov-based finite volume scheme.

Parameters:
	edit file test.nml

There are 2 differents variants of the numerical scheme which are different in term 
of allocated memory. Use parameter implementationVersion = 0 or 1 to change.

Initial condition: a discontinuity along the domain diagonal

Example of use:
./euler2d ./test.nml

Output: 
	VTK ascii file using VTK Image Data format
Visualization: 
	paraview --data=euler2d_..vti
